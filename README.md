# Sentiment Analysis

**Sentiment analysis** (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.

# Data Labeling
Used here is **TextBlob**, a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.  
It's documentation [here.](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html)

# Data Collection

The Twitter API **tweepy** was used to collect tweets relating to the current pandemic of COVID-19 facing the world.  
You may view the script I designed for this task in this [repo.](https://github.com/lyraxvincent/twitter-tweepy)
